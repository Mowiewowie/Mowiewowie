## Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹ 
### About me
I am currently a student of a Microsoft program that is teaching cloud application development. I am also trying to create a web app with some of my friends (more on that in the future)! Grab a coffee, browse around, and let's share some ideas!

### Some quick points
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web app! More info will be released once we reach MVP!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#, JavaScipt, HTML/CSS, Azure, and various other technologies
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on tips and tricks for JavaScripts. Any cool Youtube channels?
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about snowboarding, 3D printing, and anything tech related!
