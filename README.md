## 👋  Welcome to my profile! 👋 
### About me
I am currently a student of a Microsoft🪟 program that is teaching cloud☁️ application development. I am also trying to create a web🕸️ app with some of my friends (more on that in the future)! Grab a coffee☕, browse around🔍, and let's share some ideas🧠!

### Some quick points
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a web app! More info will be released once we reach MVP!
- 🌱 Learning C#, JavaScipt, HTML/CSS, Azure, programming design patterns (OOP, MVC), and various other technologies
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on tips and tricks for JavaScript and React for my web app. Any cool Youtube channels?
- 💬 Ask me about snowboarding, 3D printing, and anything tech related!
